Lecture notes from Quantum Technologies I. 
Each chapter follows the name and structure of the lectures given. 
The chapters are then split up into their respective files. 

- Lecture 1: introduction.tex
- Lecture 2: ionsources.tex
- Lecture 3: particleaccelerators.tex
- Lecture 4: transport.tex
- Lecture 5: beamparameters.tex
- Lecture 6: basicsofinteraction.tex
- Lecture 7: interaction2.tex
- Lecture 8: ionrange.tex
- Lecture 9: channeling.tex
- Lecture 10: beammethods.tex
- Lecture 11: ionbeamsinsemiconductor.tex

The above files are then called in the file `notes.tex`, which is the main file one should compile. There one will also find the typesetting of the pages, like linewidth, pagesize, etc., as well as the packages used. It is very straightforward. 

 The pictures are all found in `/src/` and come from either open source (Wikipedia), sourced (in Bibliography), or from the lecture slides. 


In principle there is a bibliography file, labeled `references.bib`, but I could not manage to compile it correctly, therefore in `notes.tex` the sources are written using pure latex. If you can figure it out then good for you. 

This repository is intended only to share the reproducibility of the notes written. Feel free to use them. Email me with any questions regarding that which is contained in the notes or latex stuff: adamkit11@gmail.com
